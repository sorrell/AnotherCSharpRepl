# ACSR (Another CSharp Repl)
The purpose of this project is to show how quickly and easily a REPL can be created with the help of InteractivePrompt, giving 
the user full access to a command history, and any completions the user would like to pass along.

In this example, we pass the whole command back into the completion list (not just the LHS).
